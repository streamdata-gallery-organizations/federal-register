description: The Federal Register, abbreviated FR or sometimes Fed. Reg., is the official
  journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government
  agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.[1] It is published daily, except
  on federal holidays. The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published
  in the Federal Register are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and
  codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is updated annually.
